# Summation

Use Summation through the public `sum-api`. Do not call internal services directly.

## Core Workflow

1. Determine the environment from the user or `SUM_API_BASE_URL`.
2. Fetch the live OpenAPI document from `{SUM_API_BASE_URL}/openapi.json`.
3. Inspect tags, operation IDs, schemas, and examples before choosing an endpoint.
4. Authenticate with caller-provided credentials only.
5. Call `sum-api`, then summarize the result with request IDs and relevant pagination details.

Default base URL:

```bash
https://sandbox-api.summation.com
```

## Helper

Prefer the bundled helper for deterministic discovery and calls. Resolve it from this skill's base directory (shown at the top of this skill when loaded).

```bash
SKILL=<this skill's base directory>
python3 $SKILL/scripts/sum_api.py openapi
python3 $SKILL/scripts/sum_api.py operations projects
python3 $SKILL/scripts/sum_api.py describe create_project_v1_projects_post
python3 $SKILL/scripts/sum_api.py schema FileWriteRequest
python3 $SKILL/scripts/sum_api.py call GET /v1/projects
python3 $SKILL/scripts/sum_api.py operation list_agent_projects_v1_projects_get
```

### Subcommands

- `openapi` — full OpenAPI document.
- `operations [search]` — list operations; filter by method, path, tag, operationId, or summary.
- `describe <operationId>` — print one operation's resolved schema (parameters, request body, responses) **without calling it**. Use this before mutating endpoints.
- `schema <Name>` — print a component schema with `$ref`s resolved. Substring match if no exact hit (errors if ambiguous).
- `call <METHOD> <path>` — call any path directly. Flags: `--query`, `--body`, `--stream`.
- `operation <operationId>` — call a discovered operation. Flags: `--params`, `--body`, `--stream`.
- `token` — print a fresh M2M access token (for piping into `curl`).
- `login` — start device login, store temporary local polling state (`0600`), and return chat-safe fields (`verification_uri_complete`, `user_code`, `expires_in`). Accepts `--base-url` for environments that are not already configured.
- `login-poll` — poll the locally pending device login to terminal state; on `approved` it stores the device-login credential locally and clears the temporary polling state. Accepts `--profile` to select among multiple pending logins.
- `logout` — revoke the stored device-login session and remove its local credential from the selected profile without touching M2M settings.
- `configure` — write local M2M configuration (mode `0600`) for fallback/admin use.
- `profiles` — list named profiles in `.summation-config` with secrets redacted.
- `use-profile <name>` — set the active profile in `.summation-config`.
- `doctor` — sanity check (base URL, config file, OpenAPI reachability, auth inputs).
- `preflight` — authenticated environment summary: identity, org, projects, tables, views, connections (counts + names, secrets-safe).
- `audit [--tail N]` — print recent API audit lines; every call appends `{ts, method, path, status, duration_ms, request_id, profile}` to `~/.summation/audit.jsonl`.
- `call … --output <file>` — byte-safe download for binary exports (PDF/DOCX); never print binary bodies to stdout.

Every API-facing subcommand accepts `--profile <name>` to use a named profile for that call.

### First-run source map

For a **brand-new user** (no config, or they ask how to get started), hand off to the sibling `start` skill — the full guided onboarding with a visual stepper. Otherwise, the first time a user connects in a session or asks a broad question like "what do you know about my data": run `preflight`, then render a **source map** — a compact tree of connected systems (from `connections`), what was found (table/view/project counts, notable names), and 3–4 suggested first analyses phrased against the real table names. End by suggesting `/addison-internal:query` or `/addison-internal:report`. Do this once per session, not on every question.

### Tracing

Every API call is audit-logged locally with its `request_id`. When anything fails, quote the `request_id` to the user (it joins client failures to server traces) and check `audit --tail 5`.

### Streaming (SSE)

For streaming endpoints (chat create/reply, report generation, report verification, file imports), pass `--stream`. The helper sets `Accept: text/event-stream` and writes one response line at a time to stdout. In Claude Code, pair with `Monitor` so each SSE line becomes an event:

```bash
python3 $SKILL/scripts/sum_api.py call --stream \
  POST /v1/projects/<project_id>/conversations \
  --body '{"message":"..."}'
```

## Auth

Prefer device login over M2M when both are viable.

Auth precedence in the helper is:

1. `SUM_API_DEVICE_LOGIN_CREDENTIAL`
2. `SUM_API_ACCESS_TOKEN`
3. M2M via `SUM_API_CLIENT_ID` and `SUM_API_CLIENT_SECRET`

For interactive user login, use the sibling `login` skill. It owns the device-login flow, what to show the user, polling behavior, and logout guidance.

If device login is unavailable and the user already has machine credentials, fall back to M2M configuration.

The config can hold multiple tenant profiles:

```bash
SUM_API_ACTIVE_PROFILE=acme-sandbox

[profile.acme-sandbox]
SUM_API_BASE_URL=https://sandbox-api-<tenant>.summation.com
SUM_API_DEVICE_LOGIN_CREDENTIAL=sm_dls_...
SUM_API_CLIENT_ID=...
SUM_API_CLIENT_SECRET=...
SUM_API_M2M_SCOPE="agent:read agent:write"

[profile.shared-prod]
SUM_API_BASE_URL=https://api.summation.com
SUM_API_DEVICE_LOGIN_CREDENTIAL=sm_dls_...
SUM_API_CLIENT_ID=...
SUM_API_CLIENT_SECRET=...
SUM_API_M2M_SCOPE="agent:read agent:write"
```

Use:

```bash
python3 scripts/sum_api.py profiles
python3 scripts/sum_api.py use-profile acme-sandbox
python3 scripts/sum_api.py call --profile shared-prod GET /v1/projects
```

Never write credentials into committed skill source, generated examples, commits, logs, or PR descriptions.

If M2M credentials should persist locally, use:

```bash
python3 scripts/sum_api.py configure
```

This writes `~/.summation/summation-config-internal` with file mode `0600`. Config-file discovery still checks explicit `SUM_API_CONFIG_FILE`, current directory `.summation-config`, `~/.summation/summation-config-internal`, then legacy locations (installed skill `.summation-config`, home `~/.summation-config`). For resolved settings, the selected profile wins over root-level config, and shell `SUM_API_*` variables are only a fallback when the config does not provide a value. A config found only in a legacy location is migrated to `~/.summation/summation-config-internal` on first use; the legacy file is left in place.

Read `references/auth.md` before changing auth behavior or troubleshooting token failures.

## API Discovery

Do not hardcode the API catalog in the skill. The OpenAPI contract is the source of truth.

Use:

```bash
python3 $SKILL/scripts/sum_api.py operations reports
python3 $SKILL/scripts/sum_api.py operations query
python3 $SKILL/scripts/sum_api.py describe create_chat_and_stream_v1_projects__project_id__conversations_post
python3 $SKILL/scripts/sum_api.py operation create_chat_and_stream_v1_projects__project_id__conversations_post \
  --params '{"project_id":"..."}' --body '{"message":"..."}' --stream
```

Read `references/openapi.md` when route selection, pagination, streaming, idempotency, or error behavior matters.

## Safety Rules

- When serving a guided end-user flow (the `start`/`connect`/`login` skills), perform API discovery **silently**: never surface endpoint paths, operation ids, or schema inspection in the conversation — narrate outcomes only. `request_id` on failure is the one exception.
- Treat destructive operations as confirmation-gated unless the user explicitly asked for the exact deletion.
- Outward-facing actions are confirmation-gated too: anything that emails, publishes, or sends (e.g. creating or immediately running a schedule with `email_recipients`) requires reading the recipient list and cadence (with timezone) back verbatim and getting an explicit yes first. Never add recipients the user didn't name.
- Prefer list and show operations before mutations.
- Preserve org, project, and workspace context from authenticated identity or explicit user selection.
- Do not pass internal identity headers supplied by the user.
- Include idempotency keys for create or long-running operations when the OpenAPI operation documents them.
- For queries, prefer public query execution APIs and include explicit limits.
- For streaming APIs, explain that CLI-style output may arrive as SSE or NDJSON.

## MCP Relationship

If a hosted Summation MCP server is available, prefer MCP tools for structured execution. Otherwise use this skill plus live OpenAPI discovery to reach the same public API surface.
